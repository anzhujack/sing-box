// ErrNetworkChanged is the cancel cause for dials interrupted by a

// natural dial timeout (5-15s per candidate).
var ErrNetworkChanged = errors.New("smart: network changed, dial aborted")

// dialHandle is a void-pointer used only for its address identity in
// the dialCancels sync.Map. Must have non-zero size — Go coalesces
// zero-sized struct pointers to a single runtime-wide address, which
// would cause sync.Map to see all dials as the same key and silently
// collapse cancel registrations. The 1-byte pad guarantees each
// &dialHandle{} gets its own heap address.
type dialHandle struct{ _ byte }

// Network-change hook.
//
// sing-box already delivers a system-wide event when the default network
// interface changes (Wi-Fi ↔ cellular on Android, Ethernet ↔ Wi-Fi on
// desktop, interface-index renumber on routers). Every outbound that
// implements adapter.InterfaceUpdateListener receives InterfaceUpdated().
// Smart's original base class did not implement that interface — so after
// a network switch the group kept serving requests against the OLD
// freshness cache (nodes marked alive from the pre-switch interface),
// resulting in 3-15s of user-visible stalls the first time a new dial
// hit a now-unreachable node.
//
// This file adds the hook and does three things:
//
//   1. Invalidate freshness so the NEXT runHealthCheck cannot shortcut.
//      The per-node aliveAt heartbeats are dropped (the old interface's
//      success is no longer proof of reachability on the new one), and
//      the shared-worker probe freshness cache is dropped for this
//      group's test URL too.
//
//   2. Schedule a ONE-SHOT forced runHealthCheck on the shared timing
//      wheel. urltest.URLTestWithDetail triggers a full TLS/QUIC
//      handshake per node, which for Hysteria2/TUIC/TCP-based outbounds
//      ALSO pre-warms the protocol session. By the time the user issues
//      a real request a moment later, the QUIC session is already live —
//      turning a cold-start stall into a warm-cache hit.
//
//   3. Debounce: network-state transitions often fire multiple callbacks
//      in rapid succession (index change + IP change + carrier change).
//      We coalesce them into one warm-up pass so N Smart groups don't
//      issue redundant probe bursts within hundreds of ms of each other.
//
// Note on correctness: triggering an extra runHealthCheck is
// FUNCTIONALLY equivalent to waiting until the scheduled tick —
// singleflight in smartSharedWorker.probeOnce ensures a concurrent
// scheduled fire coalesces with the forced fire, and the freshness
// window in runHealthCheck keeps it idempotent across debounce races.
