	// preference signal — the user has decided this route is worth
	// keeping even if the algorithm would pick another. We persist that
	// intent into the weight store so that:
	//
	//  1. If the user unpins later, auto-selection still remembers the
	//     preference and biases toward the formerly-pinned node.
	//  2. The priority factor (policy_priority config rules) composes
	//     multiplicatively with the boost, matching how other weight
	//     signals combine.
	//
	// The boost is applied BEFORE CalculateWeight / PredictWeight via
	// the priority factor, so both traditional and LightGBM paths see
	// it. The training target (baseWeight = finalWeight/priorityFactor)

	// algorithmic signal, not a user-preference-inflated version, and
	// keeping the boost out of training prevents a feedback loop where
	// the model overfits to manually-pinned nodes across retrainings.
	//
	// Value picked empirically: 1.15 is large enough to survive a few
	// bad samples from a marginal pinned node (~one rank tier) without
	// making a genuinely broken node ride the pin indefinitely (two
	// consecutive failures still trip degradation / circuit breaker).

// dialWithRetry runs up to maxRetries rounds with exponential jitter backoff.

//     not the loser's full timeout. Round 1+ moves the window further
//     down the candidate list in batches of smartParallelDials.
//
//  2. NO BACKOFF WHEN THE FAILURE WAS FAST. If the whole round failed in
//     <smartFastFailThreshold (200ms), the network is fine and only these
//     specific nodes are broken. Skipping the backoff lets us burn
//     through 3-4 bad candidates in under a second.
//
//  3. BACKOFF ONLY ON TRUE TIMEOUT. If the round exceeded its deadline,
//     the upstream path probably has congestion — a short jittered
//     backoff (20-80ms) helps avoid hammering a degraded network.
//
//  4. HOT RE-SELECTION. When every batch fails and we've exhausted the
//     candidate list, trigger a fresh selectProxiesTraced that respects
//     the freshly-tripped circuit breakers — the candidates we just
//     failed against are now excluded, so fresh alternatives surface.
